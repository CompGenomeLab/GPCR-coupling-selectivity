## **Abstract:**

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) induce signal transduction pathways through coupling to four main subtypes of G proteins (Gs, Gi, Gq, G12/13), selectively. However, G protein selective activation mechanisms and residual determinants in GPCRs have remained obscure. Here, we identified conserved G protein selective activation mechanisms determining receptors’ ability to couple to a type of G protein. Herein, we performed an extensive phylogenetic analysis and identified specifically conserved residues for the receptors having similar coupling profiles in each aminergic receptor. By integrating our methodology of differential evolutionary conservation of G protein-specific amino acids with structural analyses, we identified selective activation networks for Gs, Gi1, Go, and Gq. We found that G protein selectivity is determined by not only the G protein interaction site but also other parts of the receptor including the ligand binding pocket. To validate our findings, we further studied an amino acid residue that we revealed as a selectivity-determining in Gs coupling and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We showed that previously uncharacterized Glycine at position 7x41 plays an important role in both receptor activation and Gs coupling. Finally, we gathered our results into a comprehensive model of G protein selectivity called “sequential switches of activation” describing three main molecular switches controlling GPCR activation: ligand binding, G protein selective activation mechanisms and G protein contact. We believe that our work provides a broader view on receptor-level determinants of G protein coupling selectivity.
